## Planning

#### Introduction 
Gaby and I first came up with the idea to make a Pinball Machine last year at the end of Engineering 4 when we had completed our rocket and were looking for an exciting Capstone project. To begin planning, we made a slideshow with all our essential and nonessential requirements for our project and laid out our plans for how the machine should work and all the necessary steps beforehand. [Here's a link to the Pinball Slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-0p-8omO62feyVH7SRMGAjvP5zyLEiNpoB7CkiigmQg/edit?usp=sharing).

We captured these images at Decades Arcade to gain valuable insights into the diverse features of pinball machines. While we understood that replicating every aspect might not be feasible, we aimed to incorporate our favorite elements from each machine. The spinning plate particularly stood out as uniquely captivating, inspiring us to integrate it into our own design.

This image highlights a fascinating mechanical aspect that caught our attention. The switches employed enable circuit completion with just slight pressure—a feature we found particularly intriguing. In our final design, we opted to incorporate micro switches similar to these, inspired by their efficiency, functionality and ease of installation.

This image highlights another intriguing mechanical aspect that caught our eye. We set a goal to include a solenoid in our final design for its simplicity and ease of installation.

#### Drawn Diagrams

We were faced with a decision between two base designs. The first option was a freestanding design, which would have provided a more cohesive and professional look. However, it required more materials and presented potential transportation issues. On the other hand, the tabletop design required less wood, resulting in cost savings. Ultimately, we opted for the tabletop design, especially since we already had a pinball base, making it the most practical choice.

<img src="https://github.com/elynch78/Pinball/blob/main/images/IMG_5654.jpg" height="300">

To determine the features for our pinball machine, we sketched out three of our favorite designs and selected a standout feature from each. Ultimately, we settled on incorporating a pop bumper, a spinning plate, and originally considered including both targets and rollover buttons. However, due to significant procrastination and the need to revise our timeline, we decided to forgo the last two features. Additionally, although not depicted here, we also felt it was crucial to include a scoring system for the pop bumper, which involved a "simple" LCD connection.


#### Physical Models
<img src="https://github.com/elynch78/Pinball/blob/main/images/IMG_3519.png" height="600">

This cardboard and hot glue creation was inspired by the fundamental design principles of freestanding pinball machines, similar to the arcade setups found in Decades Arcade. While not our final choice, this design provided key insights into base design. We ultimately utilized a premade base from Ms. Gibson, which perfectly suited our needs for the finished product.

<img src="https://github.com/elynch78/Pinball/blob/main/images/IMG_3517.png" height="600">

This meticulous planning phase aimed to identify our preferences and assess feasibility within a one-year timeframe. Our design encompassed a plethora of features including pop-bumpers, rails, triangle bumpers, rollover buttons, targets, and a spinning plate, although the latter proved to be overly cramped. Ultimately, due to self-imposed time constraints, we streamlined our selection to include a pop-bumper and a spinning plate.

#### Revised Plan

<img src="https://github.com/elynch78/Pinball/blob/main/images/IMG_5656.JPG" height="600">

After careful consideration, we finalized the design for our pinball machine. The features we incorporated include the pop bumper, spinning plate, flippers, shooter lane, plunger, and a panel of wood with added lights underneath to create a stunning reflection on our resin playfield and the table top base design. As an additional touch, we installed an LCD on top of the wood plank to elegantly display the score.

This diagram outlined our plans for stylizing the exterior and key aspects of the machine.

#### How We Did It ####

*Play Field*

To start, we opted for a resin kit purchased from Amazon and dedicated time to researching the most effective techniques for resin pouring. This was uncharted territory for both of us, and we were eager to learn and apply our newfound knowledge.
<img src=" " height="200">

We used a scale to ensure equal parts of both the resin and the hardener, and then mixed in grey mica powder. We ended up using 80 grams of both the resin and hardener for the playing field alone.
<img src=" " height="200">

We applied the initial layer of grey resin and let it cure for a minimum of 48 hours.
<img src=" " height="200">

After applying the first coat, we applied a thicker clear coat to cover any uneven spots. We discovered that by using small spurts of WD-40 over the surface, the oils caused the resin to create an amazing moon-like design. This unexpected result led us to change our theme from terminator to the moon, as we found it to be more unique.
<img src=" " height="200">

We then sanded down the area near the shooter lane to ensure that the ball would smoothly roll onto the field without any resistance. Additionally we used the dremil to smooth out certain areas where resin had leaked.
<img src=" " height="200">

*Base*

To start off, we applied a white primer paint to coat both the exterior and interior walls of the pinball machine. This step was taken before pouring the playfield to prevent any paint spillage. Following that, we covered the top of the pinball machine with tape and towels in preparation for the application of black spray paint.
<img src=" " height="200">
<img src=" " height="200">

We had to apply two or three coats of paint before achieving the desired level of opacity for the color.
<img src=" " height="200">

Simloutaniously throughtout this proccess we were prepping other parts of the pinball machine like the top board for the pinball machine. It was thanfully a perfect fit so all we had to do for preparation was spraypaint the wood black. 
<img src=" " height="200">

Once everything had dried, we installed metal guards at the back to enable the pinball machine to smoothly curve around its top.
<img src=" " height="200">

Then we secured the wood plank to the pinball machine using screws and a drill. Before installation, we attached the LED lights to the underside of the plank.
<img src=" " height="200">

Finally, we attached the wooden legs that came with the pinball machine using screws and a drill.
<img src=" " height="200">


#### Code & Wiring ####
No code was used for this portion of our final project.

#### Final Product ####
Overall the base and the playfeild were mainly stylistic and didnt require too much work. That being said we were able to gain new skills like how to use resin as neither of us had ever used it prior. It took around 2 months to entierly finish both of these aspects.

#### How We Did It ####

I designed the code to connect our LCD with our Pop Bumper and solenoid. We have a switch under the bottom of the pinball base that closes a circuit when the Pop Bumper is hit. The closed circuit tells the solenoid to shoot down and this tells the LCD to update the score by adding 350 to the previous value. I soldered the wires to make the arduino freestanding and we have it attached to the machine out of sight so you only see the LCD with the score posted by the top of the machine. We also added some clay that was molded to have a moonlike appearance onto the edges of the lcd to hide the metal and add to our theme. 

#### Code & Wiring ####

lcd = LCD(interface, num_rows=rows, num_cols=cols)
lcd.set_cursor_mode(CursorMode.HIDE)

while True: #if the button is pressed this will happen
     if button.value == False: #if pressed
          if oldbutton_state == 0:
               score = score + 350 #each time the button is pushed the score increases by 350
               lcd.set_cursor_pos(0, 0)
               lcd.print(str(score)) #lcd shows new score

LCD code was not the highlight of this project for me. This felt really complicated but to be honest starting out what took me the most time to get the LCD code going was simply finding the right libraries to download. I had never used an LCD code before and had no idea where to start out but I used several different websites online (linked in code) to get a feel for how the code needed to be organized and what each aspect did. I used an LCD backpack so the wiring was almost non-existent which was really nice for time, energy, and organization. Using the links I setup the libraries to the LCD and addressed everything so each part would be recognized and run smoothly between the code and LCD itself. Then I added in my code from the button because I need the points scored to show up on the display. To incorporate the points being added to the score on display, I made score a variable and set it to 0 when you start, I was able to then use an equation to make it so that each time the button was pressed, 350 points would be added to the score and stay there until added to again. 

*Wiring*

*pic here
Above is our wiring diagram for the LCD. Figuring out how to wire the Arduino to the LCD was not very difficult and we’ve used buttons several times before so that was not too hard to add in either. What WAS difficult, was soldering everything once installed. The switch was especially challenging, as it was hot glued to a piece of wood on the underbelly of the machine, and a difficult angle to get to with the soldering iron and solder while also holding the wires. (pictured above)

For the spinning plate, we decided to use CAD to design the acrylic plate itself, as we thought it would be the easiest option. Although it took multiple prints to get the exact size we needed, this was our final CAD file.

#### Drawings ####
<img src="" height="200">

#### How We Did It ####

For the spinning plate we started off by deciding on placement within the playfield and decided that the center would ultimatly be the best option. We then marked out a 7inx7in hole in the center of the playfield. This ended up causing us issues as we did not think ahead as to how we would cut the hole in the ceter of the machine. There was no simple solution to this issue. In the end we drilled holes around the outside of our outline and used those to make an indent of where the plate would ultimatly sit.
<img src="" height="200">

This process took a lengthy period of time as it was just a mess. Our method of creating the hole ended up resulting in it to be slightly uneven which we were able to mainly correct towards the end. Folllowing the hole being complete we then alligned and drilled the hole for the motor in the center of the hole.
<img src="" height="200">

Once that was done we begun the instillation process which required clay and E600 to create a strong seal between the wood and the motor.
<img src="" height="200">

Once all of the intillation was done we moved on to laser cut the spinning plate. We remeasured the hole to ensure the measurments were correct and printed a few different designs to get the izing down to the exact milimeter.
<img src="" height="200">

Once that procces was done we went back to the laser cutter to cut a small chole in the center of the acrylic to sit the plate on.
<img src="" height="200">

After that we simply slid the plate onto the motor and used a tiny ammount of adhesive to secure the plate permenatly.
<img src="" height="200">

We then used the soldering station to connect the motor to a 4xAA battery pack and a switch to turn it on and off completing this portion of our project.
